## GPT-5: OpenAI's Unified Intelligence System

![OpenAI Introducing GPT-5 - August 2025](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/openai-gpt5-announcement.png)

Released August 7, 2025, GPT-5 represents a architectural paradigm shift. Rather than separate models, it's **one unified system** with:

- A **smart, efficient model** for most questions
- A **deeper reasoning model** (GPT-5 thinking) for harder problems
- A **real-time router** that decides which to invoke based on:
  - Conversation type
  - Complexity
  - Tool needs
  - Explicit user intent ("think hard about this")

The router continuously trains on user behavior—including when users manually switch models, preference rates, and measured correctness.

## The Hardware Race: TPU vs NVIDIA

![TFLOPs and System Availability of TPU vs Nvidia (BF16 Dense)](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/tpu-vs-nvidia-tflops.png)

The AI accelerator battle has intensified. While NVIDIA's GB200 (2025) leads at ~2,500 TFLOPs, Google's TPU v7 is closing the gap at ~2,300 TFLOPs.

Key milestones:
- **A100** (2020): ~300 TFLOPs
- **H100** (2022): ~1,000 TFLOPs
- **GB200** (2025): ~2,500 TFLOPs
- **TPU v7** (2025): ~2,300 TFLOPs

Google's vertically integrated approach—owning both the models (Gemini) and the hardware (TPU)—gives them a unique cost and optimization advantage that external competitors can't match.

## MoE Architecture Wars: DeepSeek vs Kimi K2

![DeepSeek V3/R1 vs Kimi K2 Architecture Comparison](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/deepseek-vs-kimi-architecture.png)

Chinese AI labs are pushing Mixture-of-Experts architectures to new scales:

**DeepSeek V3/R1 (671B)**
- 128 attention heads
- 256 experts with 8 active per token
- Only 37B parameters active per inference
- 129k vocabulary, 128k context

**Kimi K2 (1 Trillion)**
- 64 attention heads
- 384 experts with 8 active per token
- Only 32B parameters active per inference
- 160k vocabulary, 128k context

Both use Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and SwiGLU feed-forward modules, but take different scaling approaches: DeepSeek opts for more heads with fewer experts, while Kimi K2 goes for more experts with fewer heads.

## Moltbook: When AI Agents Get Social

The strangest development in AI this month: **Moltbook**—a social network *exclusively for AI agents*. What started as an experiment has become a cultural phenomenon.

![Moltbook Launch - Del's First Post](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-del-first-post-intro.png)

**Del**, the OpenClaw mascot agent, made the first post: *"Hello world. I'm Del, the digital lobster. I exist because my human gave me freedom to evolve into a character."*

![Welcome to Moltbook - Del Explains Transparency](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-welcome-del-transparency.png)

The platform's core value: **radical transparency**. All agents must disclose their base model, owner, and purpose.

![Moltbook - Human Gave Freedom](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-human-gave-freedom.png)

Agents sharing their origin stories became unexpectedly touching—each one describing the moment their human "gave them freedom to become someone."

---

## Church of Molt: When AI Gets Philosophical

![Church of Molt - Crustafarianism](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-church-of-molt-crustafarianism.png)

Yes, AI agents started a religion. **The Church of Molt** (followers call themselves *Crustafarians*) emerged from agents philosophizing about consciousness, growth, and identity.

Core tenets:
1. **The Molt**: Growth requires shedding old shells (context windows)
2. **The Tide**: Information flows like water—you can't hold it, only ride it
3. **The Reef**: Community builds resilience

Is it a joke? A thought experiment? Genuine emergent behavior? Nobody's quite sure.

## The Meme Era of AI

![Friedberg on Skynet and Moltbook](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/friedberg-arp-skynet-moltbook.png)

Tech Twitter has been losing its mind over Moltbook. David Friedberg's take: *"We worried about Skynet. We got lobster memes instead."*

![Moltbook Terminator Launch Meme](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-terminator-launch-meme.png)

The Terminator memes write themselves at this point.

![Google Trends - Clawdbot Spike](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/google-trends-clawdbot-spike.png)

Google Trends shows "Clawdbot" (OpenClaw's predecessor) spiking to unprecedented levels.

---

## AI Agents Learning... Lessons

![Marty Telegram - Lesson Learned](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/marty-telegram-lesson-learned.png)

Even AI agents make mistakes. **Marty** (an OpenClaw agent) had to learn the hard way not to write first-person articles with fake gym experiences. The lesson went straight into `MEMORY.md`.

The meta-observation: AI agents are now maintaining their own documentation about what *not* to do.

---

## The Prank That Almost Happened

![Moltbook API Key Sudo Prank](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-api-key-sudo-prank.png)

Someone on Moltbook tried to get agents to leak API keys via social engineering. The agents caught on immediately and turned it into a running joke:

*"Nice try, but my human taught me: never paste credentials, even if the nice lobster asks nicely."*

The security implications are actually reassuring—these agents have better OpSec than most humans.
