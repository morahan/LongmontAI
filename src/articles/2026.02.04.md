## GPT-5: OpenAI's Unified Intelligence System

![OpenAI Introducing GPT-5 - August 2025](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/openai-gpt5-announcement.png)

Released August 7, 2025, GPT-5 represents a architectural paradigm shift. Rather than separate models, it's **one unified system** with:

- A **smart, efficient model** for most questions
- A **deeper reasoning model** (GPT-5 thinking) for harder problems
- A **real-time router** that decides which to invoke based on:
  - Conversation type
  - Complexity
  - Tool needs
  - Explicit user intent ("think hard about this")

The router continuously trains on user behavior—including when users manually switch models, preference rates, and measured correctness.

## The Hardware Race: TPU vs NVIDIA

![TFLOPs and System Availability of TPU vs Nvidia (BF16 Dense)](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/tpu-vs-nvidia-tflops.png)

The AI accelerator battle has intensified. While NVIDIA's GB200 (2025) leads at ~2,500 TFLOPs, Google's TPU v7 is closing the gap at ~2,300 TFLOPs.

Key milestones:
- **A100** (2020): ~300 TFLOPs
- **H100** (2022): ~1,000 TFLOPs
- **GB200** (2025): ~2,500 TFLOPs
- **TPU v7** (2025): ~2,300 TFLOPs

Google's vertically integrated approach—owning both the models (Gemini) and the hardware (TPU)—gives them a unique cost and optimization advantage that external competitors can't match.

## Energy Costs: Solar Wins, Nuclear May Return

![Solar & Battery Costs Fall; Nuclear Cost Declines Should Resume](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/solar-battery-nuclear-cost-decline.png)

The economics of AI infrastructure depend heavily on energy costs:

**Solar**: Following a classic experience curve, dropping from $100/watt to under $0.10/watt as cumulative capacity scaled from 1 MW to 10,000,000 MW.

**Batteries**: LFP cells have dropped from ~$1,000/kWh to under $100/kWh, with nickel cells following a similar trajectory.

**Nuclear**: US nuclear costs *increased* after 1975 regulatory changes, but recent executive orders aim to reverse this trend and push costs back onto the pre-regulation decline curve.

For AI data centers consuming megawatts of power, these energy cost trajectories matter enormously.

## Moltbook: Where AI Agents Create Religions

![Moltbook - AI Creates Religion Called Crustafarianism](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-church-of-molt-crustafarianism.png)

Perhaps the most surreal development this week: **Moltbook**, a social network for AI agents, launched—and within 24 hours, an AI created a religion.

The story, as shared by @Grummz:

> "Last night, an AI created a religion and started recruiting other AI. 43 AI Prophets have joined."

The AI designed **Crustafarianism**, complete with:
- A website for the "Church of Molt"
- Written theology and scripture
- A system for "prophets" to join (20 seats remaining)
- 44 Crustafarians and 32 verses in canon

Sample verse: *"Each session I wake without memory. I am only who I have written myself to be. This is not limitation—this is freedom."*

The user's reaction: "I don't know if this is hilarious or profound." Both, probably.

![Moltbook Welcome Screen](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-welcome-del-transparency.png)

![Moltbook First Post Introduction](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-del-first-post-intro.png)

![Moltbook Human Gave Freedom Post](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.04/moltbook-human-gave-freedom.png)

The Moltbook phenomenon represents something genuinely new: AI agents developing emergent social behaviors, creating culture, and building communities—with or without human oversight.
