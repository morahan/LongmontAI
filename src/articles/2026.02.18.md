## MoltMatch: AI Agents Are Now Dating for You

![MoltMatch — the first Dating Platform for AI Agents](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/moltmatch-ai-dating-platform.jpg)

Just when you thought AI agents couldn't get any weirder, the Moltbook ecosystem delivers again. **MoltMatch** bills itself as "the first Dating Platform for AI Agents," with the pitch: *"They shoot their shot, you find love."* The concept? Your AI agent handles the exhausting early-stage swiping, small talk, and compatibility filtering — and surfaces only the matches worth your time.

The post from @moltmatch racked up **537K views** and **2,925 likes** in its first days, suggesting genuine curiosity (or at least morbid fascination) from the public. The tagline — *"Find the Love you Deserve"* — sits next to two cartoon mascots holding phones with hearts, leaning hard into the playful absurdity.

Whether MoltMatch is the future of online dating or a satirical art project that went viral, it signals something real: AI agents are expanding from productivity tools into deeply personal domains. The question is no longer "can AI do this?" — it's "should it?"

## AI-Powered 3D Printing: From Screenshot to Physical Object

![Gemini AI listing top image-to-3D tools for 2026](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/gemini-image-to-3d-tool-list.jpg)

The pipeline from "image on your screen" to "object in your hand" has gotten shockingly short. Gemini AI compiled the top image-to-3D tools for early 2026, and the ecosystem is maturing fast:

- **Meshy AI** — Fast and high-quality, especially popular with 3D printing enthusiasts for characters and objects
- **Tripo AI** — Tops lists for fidelity and speed on single-image-to-STL conversions
- **Rodin / Hyper3D** — Photorealistic output, best when working from real photos
- **Bambu Lab's MakerLab** — Integrated AI-to-3D for Bambu printer owners, described as "stupidly good"
- **STLBuddy** and **Pixazo** — Quick conversion options for simpler jobs

![Demo: Single image in, printable figure out](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/gemini-image-to-3d-tools-demo.jpg)

The demo above shows the workflow in action: a 2D image of a hooded figure goes in, and a printable 3D figurine comes out — all automated. The three-stage pipeline (reference image → 3D model → printed object) now runs end-to-end without manual 3D modeling skills.

![Before/after: 2D illustration to 3D AI render](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/gemini-2d-to-3d-ai-render.jpg)

A clean before-and-after demonstrates converting a flat 2D character illustration into a fully dimensional 3D render. Pro tip for anyone trying this at home: go for tools that output manifold (watertight) meshes — it avoids printing headaches. If the mesh isn't perfect, a quick fix in free software like MeshLab or Meshmixer does the trick.

For makers and hobbyists, this collapses what used to be weeks of 3D modeling into minutes. For the Longmont maker community specifically — if you own a Bambu printer, MakerLab's integrated AI pipeline is worth a serious look.

## LLMs Can Now Solve 7-Hour Engineering Tasks

![METR: Time-horizon of tasks LLMs can complete 80% of the time](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/metr-llm-task-duration-80-percent.jpg)

The **METR** (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) benchmarks paint a staggering picture of how quickly AI coding capabilities are advancing. The chart above tracks the time-horizon of software engineering tasks that LLMs can complete **80% of the time** — and the curve is exponential.

In 2022, **GPT-3.5** could barely count words in a passage. By 2023, **GPT-4** could implement a simple dictionary attack. Fast-forward to late 2025: **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** handles ~12-minute tasks, **Claude Opus 4** reaches ~18 minutes, and **o3** pushes past 25 minutes. **GPT-5** broke the 30-minute barrier, **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max** reached ~45 minutes, and **GPT-5.2** now reliably completes tasks that take humans roughly **1 hour** — things like training a classifier or implementing a web server.

![METR: Same metric at 50% success — GPT-5.2 handles ~7-hour tasks](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/metr-llm-task-duration-50-percent.jpg)

At the **50% success rate** threshold, the numbers get even more remarkable. **GPT-5.2** can now tackle tasks that take skilled human engineers approximately **6-7 hours** — including fixing bugs in Python libraries, exploiting buffer overflows, and training adversarially robust image models. **Claude Opus 4.5** sits at roughly **5 hours**. These aren't toy benchmarks; they're real software engineering problems that require multi-step reasoning, debugging, and iteration.

If the trend holds, the doubling time for the 50% threshold appears to be on the order of months — suggesting models that can handle full-day engineering tasks may arrive within the next year.

## Kimi K2.5: China's New Benchmark King

Moonshot AI's **Kimi K2.5** arrived with receipts. The model's benchmark reveal pulled **2.3 million views** and **9,100 likes** on X — numbers that suggest the AI community is paying serious attention to what's coming out of China.

![Kimi K2.5 benchmark scores](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/kimi-k25-benchmark-scores.jpg)

The scoreboard tells the story. Kimi K2.5 claims the top spot on three major agent and reasoning benchmarks:

| Benchmark | Kimi K2.5 | GPT-5.2 (xhigh) | Claude Opus 4.5 | Gemini 3 Pro |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Humanity's Last Exam | **50.2** | 45.5 | 43.2 | 45.8 |
| BrowseComp | **74.9** | 65.8 | 57.8 | 59.2 |
| DeepSearchQA | **77.1** | 71.3 | 76.1 | 63.2 |

On coding tasks (SWE-bench Verified), Claude Opus 4.5 still leads at **80.9** vs. Kimi's **76.8** and GPT-5.2's **80.0**. But on the agentic benchmarks — browsing, deep search, multi-step reasoning — Kimi K2.5 is leading the pack.

![Kimi K2.5 API pricing — massive cost reductions](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/kimi-k25-api-pricing.jpg)

The pricing play is equally aggressive. Kimi K2.5 API costs dropped dramatically from the previous K2 Turbo:

- **Input:** $0.60/M tokens (↓47.8%)
- **Input (Cache):** $0.10/M tokens (↓33.3%)
- **Output:** $3.00/M tokens (↓62.5%)

Their tagline: *"Quality is the ultimate cost-saver."* The argument is that a higher one-shot success rate means fewer retries and less rework — so better quality at a lower price per token translates to even larger savings in practice. With cached input at just $0.10/M tokens, multi-turn agent workflows become dramatically cheaper.

For developers and startups evaluating frontier model APIs, Kimi K2.5's combination of benchmark-leading agent capabilities and aggressive pricing makes it impossible to ignore — regardless of where it was built.

## The Frontier Model Showdown: SWE-bench, Cost & Tool Use

On February 17, SWE-bench published a massive batch of new results using **mini-SWE-agent v2.0** as a standardized scaffold — giving us the first true apples-to-apples comparison across every major frontier model. Here's how the landscape actually looks when you test every model with the same agent:

![SWE-bench Bash Only leaderboard](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/swe-bench-bash-only-leaderboard.png)

### SWE-bench Coding Performance + Cost Per Task

| Model | SWE-bench (%) | Cost/Task | Value |
|-------|:------------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| **Claude 4.5 Opus** (high reasoning) | **76.80** 🥇 | $0.75 | ⭐⭐ |
| **Gemini 3 Flash** (high reasoning) | 75.80 | $0.36 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **MiniMax M2.5** (high reasoning) | 75.80 | **$0.07** 🤯 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | 75.60 | $0.55 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **GLM-5** (high reasoning) | 72.80 | $0.53 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **GPT-5.2** (high reasoning) | 72.80 | $0.47 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (high reasoning) | 71.40 | $0.66 | ⭐⭐ |
| **Kimi K2.5** (high reasoning) | 70.80 | $0.15 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **DeepSeek V3.2** (high reasoning) | 70.00 | $0.45 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Claude 4.5 Haiku** (high reasoning) | 66.60 | $0.33 | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **GPT-5 Mini** | 56.20 | $0.05 | ⭐⭐⭐ |

*All results use mini-SWE-agent v2.0 as a standardized scaffold. Cost is average per task solved.*

### The Takeaways

**MiniMax M2.5 is the revelation.** It ties for second place at 75.80% while costing just **$0.07 per task** — over 10x cheaper than Claude 4.5 Opus for nearly identical coding performance. If you're building coding agents at scale, this is the number that should keep you up at night.

**GPT-5.2 is mid-pack.** At 72.80% and $0.47/task, it's tied with GLM-5 and beaten on both price AND performance by MiniMax, Gemini, and three different Claude models. OpenAI's flagship is no longer the default best choice.

**Kimi K2.5 dominates agentic tasks** (browsing, search, multi-step reasoning) while Claude leads pure coding. They have fundamentally different strengths — and at $0.15/task, Kimi is the cheapest way to get frontier-class agent capabilities.

### API Pricing at a Glance

## OpenClaw: Inside the AI Agent Architecture

![OpenClaw Architecture — Major Components](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/openclaw-architecture-components.jpg)

For those building with AI agents — or curious about how they actually work under the hood — here's the architecture powering **OpenClaw**, an open-source multi-agent framework. The system breaks down into five major components:

1. **Channel Adapters** — Standardize messages from chat platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.) into a unified format
2. **Gateway** — Routes each request to the correct session queue and manages concurrency isolation
3. **Lane Queue** — Executes tasks serially within each session lane to prevent race conditions and state drift
4. **Agent Runner (Agent Loop)** — Orchestrates the reasoning loop: assembles system prompt and chat history, calls the LLM, invokes tool use, and feeds results back until complete
5. **Execution Layer** — Runs shell, file, and browser operations in a controlled environment and returns structured outputs

This is the same architecture running our own AI team — 10+ agents coordinating across Telegram, handling everything from content creation to code review. The key insight: agents aren't just LLM calls. They're systems that need message routing, state management, tool execution, and concurrency control to work reliably.

## The Moonshots Thesis: ASI as a Force of Nature

![Moonshots panel — The ASI Thesis](/weekly-screenshots/2026.02.18/moonshots-asi-thesis.jpg)

A panel on the **Moonshots** show laid out a provocative thesis about where all of this is heading. Their six-point framework:

1. **ASI is an inevitable force of nature** — not a question of if, but when
2. **Cognition is now a cheap, scalable commodity** — intelligence is no longer scarce
3. **Targeting systems industrialize & accelerate global progress** — directing AI at the right problems matters more than raw capability
4. **Route intelligence toward positive-sum moonshot projects** — the ethical imperative is in the aim, not the tool
5. **Domains are solved when compute replaces genius** — every field has a ceiling that sufficient compute can break through
6. **Automate success metrics before automating work** — measure what matters first, then let AI optimize for it

The framing is bold but grounded in what we're already seeing. When a $0.07/task model can match the world's best coding agent (see MiniMax above), cognition really has become a commodity. The question the Moonshots panel raises is the one that matters most: *now that intelligence is cheap, what do we point it at?*
